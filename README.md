A simple CLI tool that dumps text files from a directory into a format that's easy for LLMs to understand.

## Why?

When working with LLMs, you often need to provide multiple files as context. This tool makes it super easy by:
- Walking through a directory recursively
- Filtering out binary files and respecting `.gitignore`
- Outputting text files in a structured XML-like format that LLMs can parse

multiple lines are preserved
